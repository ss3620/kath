Reach more customers and drive sales on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp with the official Meta for WooCommerce plugin.

== Description ==

This is the official Meta for WooCommerce plugin that connects your WooCommerce website to Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. With this plugin, you can install the Facebook pixel, upload your online store catalog, enabling you to easily run dynamic ads and connect your WhatsApp Business account to automatically update customers about their orders.


Marketing on Meta platforms helps your business build lasting relationships with people, find new customers, and increase sales for your online store. With this Facebook ad extension, reaching the people who matter most to your business is simple. This extension will track the results of your advertising across devices. It will also help you:

* Maximize your campaign performance. By setting up the Facebook pixel and building your audience, you will optimize your ads for people likely to buy your products, and reach people with relevant ads on Facebook after they’ve visited your website.
* Find more customers. Connecting your product catalog automatically creates carousel ads that showcase the products you sell and attract more shoppers to your website.
* Generate sales among your website visitors. When you set up the Facebook pixel and connect your product catalog, you can use dynamic ads to reach shoppers when they're on Facebook with ads for the products they viewed on your website. This will be included in a future release of Meta for WooCommerce.
* Engage with customers on WhatsApp by updating your customers about their orders at every step, freeing up more time for you to focus on your business.

== Known limitations ==

Crash recovery uses a shutdown handler to write a disable flag and queue a sanitized crash report.
In rare PHP memory-exhaustion fatals, there may be too little memory left for the shutdown handler to run.
When that happens, the site still recovers on the next request, but the disable flag and crash report may be skipped for that request.
